        <p>
            Place the potatoes and 2 tablespoons of salt in a 
            large pot of water. Bring the water to a boil, then
             lower the heat and simmer for 10 to 15 minutes, 
             until the potatoes are barely tender when pierced 
             with a knife. Drain the potatoes in a colander, 
             then place the colander with the potatoes over the 
             empty pot and cover with a clean, dry kitchen towel. 
             Allow the potatoes to steam for 15 to 20 minutes.
